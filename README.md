This is a single-page web application designed to demonstrate my experience in modern web development frameworks, database integration, and server-side programming.
The application integrates front-end and back-end technologies to provide an interactive, responsive, and functional experience. 

The application incorporates a responsive design, built using HTML and CSS with media queries, to ensure that the layout adapts to various screen sizes and devices. The application gives an optimal user experience whether accessed on a desktop, tablet, or smartphone, with no unnecessary horizontal scrolling or layout issues.

Dynamic content is a a major focus of the application, achieved through interactive components developed using JavaScript and React. The use of React enables the creation of reusable templates and components. These components dynamically interact with data, providing a responsive experience.

The application has database integration via backend APIs, which I developed using Java Spring Boot. These APIs enable interaction with my MySQL database to manage user and job data, supporting full CRUD operations. 

Secure authentication mechanisms are also implemented, including user registration, login, profile management, and session handling. These features ensure that user data is securely managed, and access to sensitive information or features is restricted to authorized users. The authentication process is designed to provide feedback, such as error handling for invalid credentials.

The application incorporates a line striping theme, tailored to the fictional business context. Features include job tracking functionality and detailed views of job records, showcasing practical use cases for full-stack development.
